sciencehist is a data visualization framework for the history of science (or technology,
or ideas).

Virtually every "short history of X" text is a succession of data points consisting of:
1. a period of time
2. a place or a person
3. an idea

The problem with texts like these is that most of the time, some of these events overlap,
or some important background events are lost (what else was happening in that place at
that time?).  Thus, written word, being linear, is hardly the best means to expose such
histories. This is the role that sciencehist will play, by animating dynamic and
responsive representations of histories of ideas.
